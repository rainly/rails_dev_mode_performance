Benchmarks
==========

These benchmarks are from using ab to hit up the login page of an app (7.5k lines)
that I'm working on.  All tests were run 3 times in a row and my machine was
otherwise idle.  Default dev mode settings are used:

  config.action_controller.perform_caching             = false
  config.action_view.cache_template_extensions         = false
  config.cache_classes = false

Of course (obviously) the more files you edit force more reloading which will
slow these numbers down.  I'm only showing that when just accessing an app
in development mode it should approach the speed of production.
